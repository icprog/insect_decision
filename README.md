# insect_decision

This is a collection of numerical approximations (rk4 method) for the various models of 
social insect binary nest decision making described in:

Marshall, James A. R., Rafal Bogacz, Anna Dornhaus, Robert Planqué, Tim Kovacs, and Nigel R. Franks. 2009. “On Optimal Decision-Making in Brains and Social Insect Colonies.” Journal of The Royal Society Interface, January, rsif.2008.0511. doi:10.1098/rsif.2008.0511.

Also included is a a GUI for tweaking parameters and visualizing the outcome; this is coded using the QT framework. See `insect_decision.pdf` for more information.

This project was initially developed as an exercise for exploring (i) numerical approximation and (ii) QT.
